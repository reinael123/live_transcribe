Real-Time Tagalog to Cebuano TranslatorThis application provides real-time, voice-to-voice translation from Tagalog to Cebuano. It captures audio from your microphone, transcribes it, translates the text using a powerful AI model, and then speaks the translation aloud.How It WorksSpeech-to-Text (STT): It uses the Vosk library for offline transcription of spoken Tagalog.Translation: The transcribed Tagalog text is sent to the Google Gemini API for accurate, context-aware translation into Cebuano.Text-to-Speech (TTS): The resulting Cebuano text is converted back into speech using Microsoft Edge's TTS service.Interface: A simple GUI built with Tkinter displays the live transcription and its translation.FeaturesLive Translation: Captures microphone audio and translates on the fly.Voice Output: Speaks the Cebuano translation using a natural-sounding voice.Simple GUI: Displays the original and translated text for clarity.Context-Aware: Remembers the last few sentences to improve translation accuracy.Setup Instructions1. PrerequisitesPython 3.xA microphone connected to your computer.2. InstallationFirst, clone this repository or download the source code. Then, install the required Python libraries by running this command in your terminal:pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file listing all the imported libraries like google-generativeai, vosk, sounddevice, edge-tts, pydub, numpy, and python-dotenv.)3. Google Gemini API KeyYou need an API key from Google to use the translation service.Obtain an API key from the Google AI Studio.Create a file named .env in the same directory as the script.Add your API key to the .env file like this:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
4. Vosk Speech Recognition ModelThe application requires a language model for Vosk to understand Tagalog.Download the Tagalog model (look for "vosk-model-tl-ph...").Unzip the file.Place the resulting model folder (e.g., vosk-model-tl-ph-generic-0.6) in the same directory as your Python script.How to RunOnce the setup is complete, you can run the application from your terminal with this command:python your_script_name.py
The application window will appear, and it will start listening for Tagalog speech immediately. Speak into your microphone, and you will see the transcription and hear the Cebuano translation.CustomizationChanging the VoiceYou can easily change the voice used for the Text-to-Speech output.Open the Python script (your_script_name.py).Find the line that defines the tts_voice variable:tts_voice = "fil-PH-BlessicaNeural"
Replace "fil-PH-BlessicaNeural" with the ShortName of any other voice from the list of available Edge TTS voices.You can find a complete list of voices here.Example: To use the male Filipino voice, change the line to:tts_voice = "fil-PH-AngeloNeural"
